## Contacts app 
This is a basic scratch application that I made to learn the basics of DOM manipulation, browser resources, javascript and SASS preprocessor. It manipulates data in the localstorage to save contacts.  

It can save, read and delete saved contacts as the main app features. Also supports a custom dark mode witch is under developmnt yet.

I leave a screenshot image of the app:
